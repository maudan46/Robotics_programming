This is my second activity for my programming class

In the bash_shell.md you will find some of the basics bash commands that we will use

In the git_github.md you will find some of the basics git commands that we will use to deliver our homeowrk and upload our code to github.

Beacuse i couldn't find a partner for this homework, i decided to create another account, and make the pull request, actually this modification was made using my secondary account called Maudan30.
