Silver: Exam style questions

* *Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when wrtiting programs?*

Because the high-level language is more understandable, fast and easy to write, in the other hand, low-level programming is more difficult.

* *What is a machine code?*

Code executed by the CPU and consist only in binary digits 0 and 1. All programs must be translated into machine code before being executed, no matter which type of language is, high-level or assembly language.

* *Give an example of high-level language?*

 Python

Gold: Answer the following questions:
* *Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?*

As i said before, the high-level language is easier to read, is faster to write and it have unlimited  number or alphabetic and numeric characters.

* *What does a translator do?*

The translator makes the high-level language or the assembly language become a machine code.

* *Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?*

Compilers and Assemblers

Platinum - Exam questions

* *What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?*

The main differences are the speed of the translator, the interpreter is slower than the compiler because the interpreted programs translate each instruction before being executed. Another important difference is that the compiler translate the whole program to produce the executable object code(machine code), but the interpreter translates and execute one line at time. And the last important difference is that the compiler does not need to be installed on their computer to run the software, the interpreter needs it. There are more differences but these are the most important in my opinion.

* *What is assembly language?*

A language used in low-level language to write code specifically for a processor level, it is written with mnemonics , mnemonics are abbreviated text commands such as LDA (LOAD), STO (STORE) and ADD

* *A developer is writing a program.

	*a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?*

	 The main difference is that the high-level language was easier to write for the programmer, if he would tried to write the same code in machine code, probably it would took more time to finish, more work or even still unfinished because of the difficulties that write a machine code implies.
       And another difference is that the code was written using a big amount of characters, such as numeric or alphanumeric characters, but if the code would have been written in machine code, it would be conformed by only a big amount of 0's and 1's
        
	*b) One type of translator is an interpreter.
	   i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code?*

	Interpreters translate the high-level language into machine code one command/line at time, and inmediately executes them.
	It's important to know that you must have the interpreter installed on your computer in order to run the software; and the program must be translated every time that it's executed. 

	*ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?*
	
	Compiler, it translates all the source code at the same time to create the compiled code, or machine code, also known as the object code.
